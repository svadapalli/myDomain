      <h4><b>About:</b></h4>
      <p>As a Software Developer, I strive to design and implement quality software products utilizing latest and greatest technologies, with emphasis on ease of use, security and scalability. As a Project Lead, I look past the job needing to be done to envision product placement and appeal to the end user, and deliver robust, well-tested code which show that integration of all parts was not an afterthought. I am a Data Science practitioner and a keen Machine Learning enthusiast.</p>

      <h4><b>My Expertise:</b></h4>
      <h4 class="sub">Front-End Developement</h4>
      <p>Frontend developement is about designing and building visual component of a website, which is easy to use, responsive to any screen size and creates a beautiful user experience, using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I heavily make use of frontend frameworks and libraries such as Angular, Bootstrap, jQuery, etc. </p>
      <h4 class="sub">Back-end Developement</h4>
      <p>Backend is where the business logic for the website is defined and data generated from the frontend is persisted. I build Backend servers using Java, PHP, Express and node. I build both SQL and NoSQL databases.</p>
